# StoryEditor
The Story Editor is a visual script Editor based on Unity X Node that lets you quickly build a text conversation without any code, and allows you to determine the direction of the Story based on your own method of triggering a click event or multiple options. 

You can also combine the Story Editor and the Unity Timeline system to complete rich cutscenes.
